# DiscordCsvReader

This python script allows you to download all attachments and texts found on discord backup csvs that you want. 
You can also filter from which contacts the attachments will be downloaded by passing a list to the jsonUtils.filterJson() method as a second parameter, located at discordcsv.py file.

It still pretty simple, I've made it to recover some shared files that I accidently deleted and could be retrieved from discord's backup.
